    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      Through my background as a jazz musician and small business owner, I developed strong problem solving and collaboration
      skills, as well as a passion for continuous education. I am focused on applying these experiences to not only the
      software I build but also the teams I work on.I profoundly believe that if you put your mind to something while enjoying
      the learning process, you can achieve great things. Eight years ago, I started a business with some friends because I
      had become interested in roasting coffee. We were able to take that business from modest beginnings in a garage to a
      warehouse where we were supplying many businesses in Denver. We did this because we embraced the process--celebrating
      the successes and learning from the failures. In a separate path, I was able to go from being a mediocre self-taught
      pianist to receiving a Masters degree in jazz piano performance from the University of Denver. Again, the common
      denominator was trusting the process and staying focused. When I think about my experience in software engineering so
      far, I see that same growth process and it makes me excited for the future.
